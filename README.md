## Code Review

> This assignment looks at part of the process in implementing a problem – **a code review**. A code review is a review of your code by another developer or developers. Code reviews can help with:<br/>
>
> - Motivation
> - Sharing best practice <br/>
>
> Also they can highlight:
>
> - Accidental/Structural errors
> - Legibility <br/>
>
> Even short, informal code reviews can have a great impact on code quality and error frequency.<br/> You should for this assignment:<br/>
>
> <ol type ='A'>
>  <li> Submit some code (which is described below) to your colleagues for peer review </li>
>  <li>Provide helpful reviews on the other students code </li>
> </ol>
> The questions which you should ask in your review are:
> <ol>
> <li> Is the code properly documented/commented?
>   <ol type = 'A'>
>    <li> Does it need more work ?/Is it great?</li>
>    <li> Where should it be better?</li>
>   </ol>
>    </li>
> <li> Does the code handle errors properly?
>   <ol type = 'A'>
>    <li> Does it need more work?/Is it great?</li>
>    <li> Where would it be better?</li>
>   </ol>
> <li>What suggestions do you have to improve the code?</li>
> </ol>
