## Code Review

>This assignment looks at part of the process in implementing a problem â€“ **a code review**. A code review is a review of your code by another developer or developers. Code reviews can help with:<br/> 
>- Motivation
>- Sharing best practice <br/>
>
>Also they can highlight:
>- Accidental/Structural errors
>- Legibility <br/>
>
>Even short, informal code reviews can have a great impact on code quality and error frequency.<br/> You should for this assignment:<br/> 
><ol type ='A'>
>  <li> Submit some code (which is described below) to your colleagues for peer review </li>
>  <li>Provide helpful reviews on the other students code </li>
